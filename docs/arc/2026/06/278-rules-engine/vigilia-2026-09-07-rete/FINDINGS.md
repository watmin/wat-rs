# FINDINGS — vigilia 2026-09-07, rete

> ⛔ **THIS FILE IS THE ONLY PLACE A ROW'S STATUS LIVES.** Edit in place; never append a closure
> below a row. `reports/` holds each ward's verbatim return as EVIDENCE — it carries no status, and
> a status read from a report rather than from this table is a status nobody maintains.
>
> The rule and its cost: `WORK-LIST.md:10-13` of the 2026-09-05 cast said *"One row, one place"*,
> and `RETE-BOARD.md` — same directory, four days later — shipped its own status column anyway.
> Both copies then rotted in lockstep: **nine rows read OPEN while every one was already cured.**

> ⭐ **EVERY ROW CARRIES A RE-DERIVATION** — the command, gate or grep that decides its status
> *now*. A row without one is a claim, and this arc has proved that claims rot silently while
> nobody re-checks them. If you cannot write the re-derivation, the finding is not yet understood
> well enough to row.

**Severity:** L1 = a correctness lie · L2 = a structural mumble · L3 = taste (noted, does not count
toward convergence). Passed through from each ward verbatim — this table never re-classifies.

**Priority is not written down.** Apply `vigilia`'s rule at read time — L1 before L2, most upstream
ward first — against status you have just re-derived. The last board's static order named a cured
row first for days.

## Rows

| id | ward | target | site | finding | sev | status | re-derivation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **I1** | intueri | 1 | `fire/pass/accumulate.rs:18` | `accumulate_pass`'s doc promises only *"dispatch the accumulate nodes"*; the body ALSO runs pass 3.20 — pre-dispatching `Test` parents that feed an accumulate, so `filter_pass` can skip them. A reader trusting the doc misses that a sibling pass's inputs are seeded here. | L2 | **OPEN** | `grep -q dispatch_where_tests src/rete/kernel/fire/pass/accumulate.rs && sed -n 18p … \| grep -qiv pre-dispatch` — closed when the doc names both responsibilities, or 3.20 becomes its own fn |

## Cast log

| # | target | cast at | wards mustered | returns in `reports/` | L1 | L2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `src/rete/kernel/` + `wat/rete/oracle/` | 2026-09-07 | 13 inward + circumspicere last | intueri ✓ (in flight: solvere, purgare, struere, conferre) | 0 | 1 |

## Verified by the orchestrator, not taken

Every row above was re-read against the disk before it was rowed; a ward's verdict is a hypothesis
until a `file:line` confirms it.

- **I1** — CONFIRMED. `accumulate.rs:59` clears `pre_dispatched`, `:76` calls `dispatch_where_tests`,
  `:88` inserts into it. The second responsibility is real and the doc at `:18` does not name it.

## Runes weighed

| rune | verdict |
|---|---|
| `rune:intueri(naming)` at `wat/rete/oracle/fire.wat:54` — *"the name is the historical walk-sorted-ids split, not filter-alone"* | **CLEAR, confirmed.** `walk-filter-ids` does dispatch `accumulate-pass`, `filter-pass` AND `hash-join-pass` (verified over `:57-76`). The rune names the mismatch honestly and gives a checkable cost for the rename. |

## Convergence, per ward

| ward | verdict |
|---|---|
| intueri | 0 L1 + 1 L2 — **DIVERGES** (narrowly) |
