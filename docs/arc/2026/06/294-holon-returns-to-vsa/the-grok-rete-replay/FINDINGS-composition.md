# FINDINGS — the chain-composition check

The replay converts each grok-rete `.wat` by running main's recorded migrations over it. Stone 0 made
every migration correct **alone**, against its fixture. This check proves the chain **in composition**:
chain(file@base) is compared with file@main over the 1,001 files main changed since `de827fb4c`, plus
the 488 files main never touched as a control.

The runner is `bootstrap/composition/run.sh`. It uses the FROZEN binary
`bootstrap/wat-replay-base-8a5b7eb20` and the exported tree `bootstrap/composition/tree-8a5b7eb20`, runs
at nice 19, and never touches the working tree. Runs land in `bootstrap/composition/runs/`. Before the
full run, it was timed on one file: 54 s, 46 s of it `positional-ctor-to-map`.

## Finding 1 — a later sweep co-updated an EARLIER tool (silent)

- `positional-ctor-to-map` (landing-order line 25) matches the qualified `:wat::core::Option::Some`,
  because `49f03f179` (step 26's own sweep) rewrote its match strings.
- A bare `(:wat::core::Some 1)` therefore prints UNRESOLVED and is left unchanged. Step 26
  (`bare-variant-to-qualified`) then leaves it **positional**, a form main retired.
- Each tool's fixture passes; only the composition fails.

## Finding 2 — an eval-based tool runs on TODAY's substrate (loud)

- Baseline run (landing order), step 23 `match-arm-to-bracket-map-pattern`, rc=2 on
  `tests/process/probe_arc278_init_crash_reason.wat`:
  `assertion-failed! takes kwargs … the positional form is retired` (`wat/kernel/assertion.wat:34`).
- Its `try-type-of` EVALUATES the file's declarations to learn field names. Today's runtime has retired
  a form that a LATER step (24, `assertion-failed-to-kwargs`) migrates.
- `order-v2` = landing order + two evidence-backed moves: assertion-failed before match-arm, and
  bare-variant before positional-ctor. With v2, match-arm completes (rc 0, 478 changed).

## Finding 3 — one unmigrated BODY poisons a whole file's type resolution

- v2 step 24: match-arm has **403 UNRESOLVED over 160 names in 77 files**. They are nearly all
  `<Svc>::<Method>Response::{Ok,RequestTooLarge,RequestMalformed}`.
- Main converted these arms (e.g. `tests/comms/probe_arc293_W2f_process_dials_thread.wat`), so they are
  CHAIN residuals.
- Mechanism: `try-type-of` = `eval-with-defs! (type-of E)` over ALL top-level `file-decls`.
  `decl-head?` admits pure type declarations AND `defservice` / `sift-rules-defsvc` / `defmacro`. A
  `defservice` whose `:impls` hold a base-era positional `::` constructor (`unknown callee:
  :probe::Echo::EchoResponse::Ok`) fails, so the whole eval fails and the fallback has no decls.
- That is a potential **cycle**: match-arm needs positional-ctor's and the dot flip's output, and
  positional-ctor also evaluates decls. Reordering cannot break a cycle.

### Two candidates, probed

- **(A) The era binary for the eval-based steps.** `git archive 480f38d05`, then `cargo build` in
  `bootstrap/era/` (needs the link `bootstrap/era/holon-rs` → `../holon-rs`; 52 s). The era match-arm
  on the era binary, on the example after steps 1–23: **UNRESOLVED 0, bracket arms 3 = main**. Today's
  gives 3 / 0.
  - Cost: positional-ctor's era text predates A′/(c), ~65 s/file.
  - Cost: era builds depend on today's `holon-rs` still compiling.
- **(B) Evaluate ONLY pure type declarations, at any depth; never bodies.** `file-decls` becomes a deep
  walk collecting `defenum`/`defrecord`/`defstruct`/`defsurface`/`newtype`/`typealias`/`typeunion`
  (`bootstrap/era/probe-B/match-arm-typedecls-only.wat`). Result on the example: **UNRESOLVED 0,
  bracket arms 3 = main**, on the frozen binary.
  - Indicator: 325 of 333 (name, file) pairs have an explicit in-file `defenum`, so (B) should reach
    ~98%.
  - The ~8 left are macro-GENERATED (defservice Op/Reply, the acronym registry,
    `generated-template-without-fqdn`).
  - The 77-file side-by-side is running. Two earlier attempts were a harness kill and a relative-path
    bug in my own runner (both runs got empty stdin), so neither measured anything.

## Operational notes (all paid for today)

- Long runs are launched `setsid nohup`: the harness's memory guard kills tracked background tasks.
  Twice today it fired on a transient spike, and the only kernel OOM victim was an unrelated 29 GB
  `python3`.
- `pgrep -f '<script path>'` matches your OWN shell's text. Match the runner's argv prefix.
- A codemod piped EMPTY stdin dies with `"disconnected"`. That is never-ran, not "0 unresolved".
